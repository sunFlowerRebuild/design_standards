# Design Standards
The sunFlower Rebuild Project Design Standards describe the standards used within all designs. As new types of designs will emerge over time with associated requirements for standardization the Design Standards will evolve over time and new standards will be added.

As the concept used for the creation of building block is based upon the concepts of “open source”, it allows for multiple people contributing to the development in a community fashion and the intention of a building block is to ensure it can easily be included and other and wider projects there is a need to ensure standardization. As the intention is to ensure people are able to contribute to the development in a community fashion the use of community centric platforms and open standards for design is promoted. 

By ensuring the same standards are used across projects this will improve the ability to include work from other projects in your own project and vice versa. In addition, by adopting the same standers across projects misinterpretation and mistakes are prevented. 

Specifically for standards on file formats the intention is to ensure that file formats used are based upon open standards are accessible by both commercial and open source platforms. The main intention is to ensure proprietary formats are avoided (as much as possible). Close sourced formats and proprietary formats are not encouraged, whenever used within a project the closed sourced format or proprietary format should be a derived version from an open source standard file format. 

As an example, when a .PDF file is shared as part of a projects repository this should be derived from a .MD based file which is shared in the same repository as the source from the .PDF file. This will allow the wider community to make changes and propose pull requests to your project when and where needed as well as providing the ability to use parts of the shared work in other projects in a seamless fashion.


## standards overview
Standards can be hard requirements or guiding principles. Where a standard is marked as “hard requirement” it is a MUST to use and adhere to the standard. When a standard is a guiding principle the standard should be seen as favorable to use and should only be deviated from with good reason. The “hard requirement” standards are as much limited as possible to ensure maximum freedom and support the needed level of creativity in engineering.

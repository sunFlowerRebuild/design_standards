# Design Standards
The sunFlower Rebuild Project Design Standards describe the standards used within all designs. As new types of designs will emerge over time with associated requirements for standardization the Design Standards will evolve over time and new standards will be added.

As the concept used for the creation of building block is based upon the concepts of “open source”, it allows for multiple people contributing to the development in a community fashion and the intention of a building block is to ensure it can easily be included and other and wider projects there is a need to ensure standardization. 

As the intention is to ensure people are able to contribute to the development in a community fashion the use of community centric platforms and open standards for design is promoted.
